# Enum extensibility policy

## Status

Accepted.

## Decision

Agent Trail keeps structural discriminators closed and descriptive state vocabulary extensible.

Structural discriminators gate parser or renderer dispatch and require a format version bump for new values. In the v0.1.0 schema, this includes event `type`, task-plan delta `kind`, attachment `kind`, and `taskPlanStatus`.

Descriptive state vocabulary accepts reserved values plus vendor-namespaced extensions of the form `x-<vendor>/<name>`. Bare unknown strings remain writer-strict errors. Readers treat unknown `x-<vendor>/<name>` values as opaque strings and pass them through.

Current extensible vocabulary includes `scope`, `reason`, `trigger`, `origin`, `command_invoke.kind`, `command_invoke.via`, and `command_invoke.result_action` slots that describe observed runtime state rather than dispatch shape. It also includes established extension surfaces such as `system_event.kind`, `vcs.type`, and `session_metadata_update.field`.

`agent.name` follows the same two-part contract: registered canonical names come from the canonical agent registry, while unregistered agents use `x-<vendor>/<name>`. Readers treat unknown `x-<vendor>/<name>` agent names as opaque strings and pass them through.

An `x-<vendor>/<name>` value observed across two or more adapters can be promoted into the reserved enum in a minor format bump. This follows the convention already stated for `system_event.kind` in the events section.

`parse_fidelity.termination_reason` and `session_terminated.reason` both refer to `#/$defs/sessionTerminationReason`. They open or close together by construction; keep the shared definition rather than duplicating the enum.

## Rationale

Closed enums are useful where a new value changes dispatch semantics, rendering shape, graph validation, or cross-record invariants. They are too expensive for adapter-specific state vocabulary, because every source-specific reason, trigger, scope, or invocation channel would otherwise need a schema revision and minor format bump before a writer could preserve it.

The `x-<vendor>/<name>` grammar already works for `system_event.kind` and `vcs.type`: reserved values stay portable, while vendor variance remains namespaced and machine-recognizable. Applying the same rule to descriptive state vocabulary keeps writer-strict validation strict without forcing lossy normalization.

## Consequences

- Schema changes that add new structural discriminator values require a format version bump.
- Schema changes that add reserved descriptive enum values can land in a minor format bump after adapter evidence shows cross-agent use.
- Writers must use `x-<vendor>/<name>` for non-reserved descriptive values and must not emit bare unknown strings.
- Readers should not fail only because an otherwise valid descriptive enum uses an unknown `x-<vendor>/<name>` value.
- Future schema edits should keep shared definitions shared when two fields are intentionally coupled, as with `#/$defs/sessionTerminationReason`.
