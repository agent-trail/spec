## Appendix B — Content hash worked example

This example shows the §7.3 two-pass procedure for the
`hash-vectors/minimal-pending-roundtrip.trail.jsonl` conformance fixture. The
remaining canonicalization and two-tier identity cases are published in the
`hash-vectors/` fixture category.

Input file before stamping:

```jsonl
{"type":"session","schema_version":"0.1.0","id":"01HSESS0000000000000000101","content_hash":"<pending>","ts":"2026-05-17T14:00:00.000Z","agent":{"name":"codex-cli"}}
{"type":"user_message","id":"01HEVTA0000000000000000101","ts":"2026-05-17T14:00:05.000Z","payload":{"text":"hello"}}
{"type":"agent_message","id":"01HEVTA0000000000000000102","ts":"2026-05-17T14:00:07.000Z","payload":{"text":"hi"}}
```

Canonical bytes hashed by SHA-256, shown as UTF-8 text with the required trailing
newline after the last line:

```jsonl
{"agent":{"name":"codex-cli"},"content_hash":"<pending>","id":"01HSESS0000000000000000101","schema_version":"0.1.0","ts":"2026-05-17T14:00:00.000Z","type":"session"}
{"id":"01HEVTA0000000000000000101","payload":{"text":"hello"},"ts":"2026-05-17T14:00:05.000Z","type":"user_message"}
{"id":"01HEVTA0000000000000000102","payload":{"text":"hi"},"ts":"2026-05-17T14:00:07.000Z","type":"agent_message"}
```

Resulting session-level digest:

```text
